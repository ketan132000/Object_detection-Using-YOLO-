What is Object Detection and classification?

Object Detection is a computer vision task which gives the machine an ability to detect the instances of object present in an image or a video. This technique tells the exact location of the visual object(s). 

Let's understand the whole concept of object detection using an image.

In the above image the major objects that we can detect through our naked eyes are:-
a) A Dog
b) A bicycle
c) A truck

So when the process of Detecting and classifying the objects in the above picture is performed by the computer, this process is called object detection and classification.

The following is the output that the machine will provide us with after performing the object detection and classification task.
